# phase-1-project

This website will take in names and output a guess about their most likely age, gender and nationality. The data comes from three sources: 

https://api.agify.io
https://api.genderize.io
https://api.nationalize.io

which in turn get their data from international databases of population data.

There appear to be some errors in the data itself; you may see a nationalities result like:

1. Japan
2. 
3. Italy
